# Odin Recipes

This is the first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s course, **Foundations**. It consists of a main index page that points to a few recipes.

By building this, I'll show my basic skills of HTML, by understanding the use of `head`, `body`, the HTML boilerplate, and a few of the HTML tags, such as `a`, `p`, `h1`, etc.

The recipes are extracted from [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
